Mohammad Rizwan | Player of the Match: If you look at the whole match, they played really well. So have to credit them guys. Chasing 194 is not easy as Ireland know the conditions and they gave difficult time early on but we decide to attack and this is why we were successful. You always feel pressure when we lose. I don't look at my numbers, if you look at the average, you are an average player. If you look at the match situation and the conditions then it's better. [on him and Kohli being the only two to average 50+ in T20Is] About Kohli, he is a good player and we learnt a lot from him, I respect him.

Babar Azam | Pakistan captain: [on the win] It's a relief to be honest. All the credit to the batsmen for the way they are playing. At the innings break, we decided to chase in 18 or 19 overs. First 6 overs we lost two but Rizwan and Fakhar built the momentum. [on bowling first] Good decision as it was overcast and there was rain over there. Second half bowled well but did not finish well. 170-180 was a par score but the way Ireland played last 3 overs, all credit to them. [on Rizwan] He is experienced and he is playing according to situation and it demands positive intent. The counter-attack is good for us. It's a good side to be honest. We are looking forward to the next match and will give our 100%. We are excited as we last played in 2016. All jam-packed and enjoyed the fans. Want all the fans to come out and support us.
